# Progressive Software Licenses

Progressive Software is a proposed idea that Free and Open Source Software
must not only be free to their developers and users, but also for the whole
society, in special the communities (possibly or potentially) affected by
software's activities. With that in mind, we would like to make fair,
social justice promoting, environmentally sustainable and socially
responsible software through better FOSS licenses.

The PFSPL below is the first FOSS license in that sense that we're working
on.

## PROGRESSIVE AND FREE SOFTWARE PUBLIC LICENSE (PFSPL)

Welcome to PFSPL's repository. This is the place to discuss, submit
patches, make proposals, etc to this family of public licenses.

### Project Status

We are working from time to time to deliver the first draft of this
license, but it's a work in progress and it's progressing very slow on our
spare time. I expect to finish it by Aug 2022, so it can be announced and
oficially opened for discussion and a community (and professional) review.

### Contributing

While the project is still a draft, you can contribute by submitting a
patch adding or changing the current text. They will be evaluated to see if
they align well with the philosophy behind this license. In a future moment
this document will contain more details on that. Anyway, any input will be
appreciated as long as they help free and open source software to be more
ethical, socially and environmentally responsible, progressive and more
adherence with high standards of social justice and protection to
minorities and affected communities.
